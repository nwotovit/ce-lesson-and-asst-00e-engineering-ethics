**1. General Ethics**

I would argue that virtue ethics can give a general definition of ethics because it discusses moral rules and asks questions such as what does it mean to live a "good" - or virtuous - life. One of these moral rules found in the virtue ethics entry of the encyclopedia gives a standard and general definition that simply states, "Do unto others as you would be done by". I believe virtue ethics can be applied to many if not all other domains of ethics. Some novel domains I found interesting were "internet research ethics", "ethics of stem cell research", and "social networking ethics". These were all interesting to me because they all deal with ethics in new technology and advances within our society. I think this really shows us that ethics will forever be evolving and changing at the same pace humans advance themselves.
