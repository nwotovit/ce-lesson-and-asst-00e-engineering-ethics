**1. General Ethics**

I would argue that virtue ethics can give a general definition of ethics because it discusses moral rules and asks questions such as what does it mean to live a "good" - or virtuous - life. One of these moral rules found in the virtue ethics entry of the encyclopedia gives a standard and general definition that simply states, "Do unto others as you would be done by". I believe virtue ethics can be applied to many if not all other domains of ethics. Some novel domains I found interesting were "internet research ethics", "ethics of stem cell research", and "social networking ethics". These were all interesting to me because they all deal with ethics in new technology and advances within our society. I think this really shows us that ethics will forever be evolving and changing at the same pace humans advance themselves. 

In Aristotle's ethics work he seems to put the responsibility on the individuals of society. For Aristotle, living a moral and ethical life revolves around virtuism. He also says happiness can only be obtained by living a virtuous life, and an individual can only be virtuous by finding eternal and universal truth.

**2. Applied Ethics**

If all individuals were ethical in their actions we would see an absence of corruption in business and politics. I think these two fields are where we see the most corruption in modern society. Where large business owners and political figures leech off of their lower employees or followers for their own gain. If these "leaders" were completely ethical, we would see a major shift in what is accepted and practiced in politics and large businesses. Certain strategies and practices in these field would be abolished because some are extremely unethical.

In the past two decades we have seen technology companies - such as apple or samsung - manufacture their products on a massive scale. Their factories, which are mostly located in Asian countries, employee individuals who work for substantially less money than people in North America would. This use of factories in other countries allows companies to manufacture their technology very efficiently for the large group of consumers, but at the cost of these individuals working for them. A possible solution to "fix" global manufacturing would be a world-wide standardized currency. This could balance the interests of individual workers and the large group of technology consumers by giving everybody's time and money equal value.

**3. Current Ethics Examples**

The main ethical conflict that arrises from natural disasters is the balance of studying the natural disaster while also providing relief for those affected by it. The scientists argue that research and data from these catastrophes can greatly change the damage and outcome of future disasters. While individuals deeply affected argue that more energy should be used to alleviate the trauma of victims. I personally think that a balance of the two is the best approach after these natural disasters occur, but this is a complicated dilemma that is extremely subjective.

One challenging ethical issue created by covid-19 is medical practices. Doctors and physicians have to make difficult decisions about which patients should have priority when being cared for. As well as balancing their use of limited resources. Questions such as "Who gets priority if and when a vaccine is created?" really have no right answer. Another issue that has arrised is the "Stay Home" policy that many states and countries have adopted. Is having the majority of society stay home worth the damage it is doing to individuals, businesses, and the world economy? This is another very difficult question that does not have one simple answer. There are an infinite number of variables that governments and individuals must consider before deciding the best approach. Lastly, the practices of media are extremely important during these times. The question of "How much should be shared with the public in order to inform but not create panic in society?" All of these issues are very subjective and don't hold a single correct answer. That in itself is one of the greatest issues from this pandemic. Everybody has different opinions on what should be done to balance the advancement of humanity and health of humanity. 

**4. Engineering Ethics**

After reading the ACM's Code of Ethics I better understand the scale at which ethics is practiced in computer engineering. I always understood that it is a big part of CPE, but never realized how important and specific it is. As well as how seriously it is treated. One part of the Code of Ethics I found interesting was Section 2.6 - Perform work only in areas of competence. I think it is a crucial addition to make sure engineers are only working in areas that they accel in. This section forces efficiency in the advancement of computer engineering and technology. 

The Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct addresses the "rules" of participating in their open source community. It is targeted to any and all members of this community, in order to create a civil and efficient platform. The most important ethical behavior of this code is to provide an inspiring and safe platform for the entire community. The OSS from Microsoft we have been using for this course is Github.

The article hints that data ethics needs to be developed at the start of all other computer ethics categories and take into account all other computer macroethics. This is because data ethics is a small part of all other computer ethics subdomains.

The conference needs its own Code of Conduct to ensure that the interactions of everybody attending are safe and productive. Similar to why Microsoft needs a specific Code of Conduct for their open source platform.

Google is concerned that AI will arrise issues such as unfair bias, breach of individuals privacy, and technologies that are likely to cause harm. Google is referring to their responsibility to develop these technologies in ways that don't create or create these issues as little as possible. 

The term "ethical hacking" seems strange because people normally associate ethics with doing the good or right thing. People also normally associate the word hacking with causing harm, or doing the wrong thing. "Ethical" and "hacking" can be strung together because hacking is often used to improve computer security. By using ethical hacking, we can decrease the use of unethical hacking by making it more complicated and difficult.
