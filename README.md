**1. General Ethics**

I would argue that virtue ethics can give a general definition of ethics because it discusses moral rules and asks questions such as what does it mean to live a "good" - or virtuous - life. One of these moral rules found in the virtue ethics entry of the encyclopedia gives a standard and general definition that simply states, "Do unto others as you would be done by". I believe virtue ethics can be applied to many if not all other domains of ethics. Some novel domains I found interesting were "internet research ethics", "ethics of stem cell research", and "social networking ethics". These were all interesting to me because they all deal with ethics in new technology and advances within our society. I think this really shows us that ethics will forever be evolving and changing at the same pace humans advance themselves. 

In Aristotle's ethics work he seems to put the responsibility on the individuals of society. For Aristotle, living a moral and ethical life revolves around virtuism. He also says happiness can only be obtained by living a virtuous life, and an individual can only be virtuous by finding eternal and universal truth.

**2. Applied Ethics**

If all individuals were ethical in their actions we would see an absence of corruption in business and politics. I think these two fields are where we see the most corruption in modern society. Where large business owners and political figures leech off of their lower employees or followers for their own gain. If these "leaders" were completely ethical, we would see a major shift in what is accepted and practiced in politics and large businesses. 

In the past two decades we have seen technology companies - such as apple or samsung - manufacture their products on a massive scale. Their factories, which are mostly located in Asian countries, employee individuals who work for substantially less money than people in North America would. This use of factories in other countries allows companies to manufacture their technology very efficiently for the large group of consumers, but at the cost of these individuals working for them. A possible solution to "fix" global manufacturing would be a world-wide standardized currency. This could balance the interests of individual workers and the large group of technology consumers by giving everybody's time and money equal value.

**3. Current Ethics Examples**

The main ethical conflict that arrises from natural disasters is the balance of studying the natural disaster while also providing relief for those affected by it. The scientists argue that research and data from these catastrophes can greatly change the damage and outcome of future disasters. While individuals deeply affected argue that more energy should be used to alleviate the trauma of victims. I personally think that a balance of the two is the best approach after these natural disasters occur, but this is a complicated dilemma that is extremely subjective.
