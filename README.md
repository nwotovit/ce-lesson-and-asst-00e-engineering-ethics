**1. General Ethics**

1.2.1) I would argue that virtue ethics can give a general definition of ethics because it discusses moral rules and asks questions such as what does it mean to live a "good" - or virtuous - life. One of these moral rules found in the virtue ethics entry of the encyclopedia gives a standard and general definition that simply states, "Do unto others as you would be done by". I believe virtue ethics can be applied to many if not all other domains of ethics. Some novel domains I found interesting were "internet research ethics", "ethics of stem cell research", and "social networking ethics". These were all interesting to me because they all deal with ethics in new technology and advances within our society. I think this really shows us that ethics will forever be evolving and changing at the same pace humans advance themselves. 

1.2.2) In Aristotle's ethics work he seems to put the responsibility on the individuals of society. For Aristotle, living a moral and ethical life revolves around virtuism. He also says happiness can only be obtained by living a virtuous life, and an individual can only be virtuous by finding eternal and universal truth. So it is completely up to the individual to be moral and ethical.

**2. Applied Ethics**

2.2.2) If all individuals were ethical in their actions we would see an absence of corruption in business and politics. I think these two fields are where we see the most corruption in modern society. Where large business owners and political figures leech off of their lower employees or followers for their own gain. If these "leaders" were completely ethical, we would see a major shift in what is accepted and practiced in politics and large businesses. Certain strategies and practices in these field would be abolished because some are extremely unethical.

2.2.3) In the past two decades we have seen technology companies - such as apple or samsung - manufacture their products on a massive scale. Their factories, which are mostly located in Asian countries, employee individuals who work for substantially less money than people in North America would. This use of factories in other countries allows companies to manufacture their technology very efficiently for the large group of consumers, but at the cost of these individuals working for them. A possible solution to "fix" global manufacturing would be a world-wide standardized currency. This could balance the interests of individual workers and the large group of technology consumers by giving everybody's time and money equal value.

**3. Current Ethics Examples**

3.2.1) The main ethical conflict that arrises from natural disasters is the balance of studying the natural disaster while also providing relief for those affected by it. The scientists argue that research and data from these catastrophes can greatly change the damage and outcome of future disasters. While individuals deeply affected argue that more energy should be used to alleviate the trauma of victims. I personally think that a balance of the two is the best approach after these natural disasters occur, but this is a complicated dilemma that is extremely subjective.

3.2.2) One challenging ethical issue created by covid-19 is medical practices. Doctors and physicians have to make difficult decisions about which patients should have priority when being cared for. As well as balancing their use of limited resources. Questions such as "Who gets priority if and when a vaccine is created?" really have no right answer. Another issue that has arrised is the "Stay Home" policy that many states and countries have adopted. Is having the majority of society stay home worth the damage it is doing to individuals, businesses, and the world economy? This is another very difficult question that does not have one simple answer. There are an infinite number of variables that governments and individuals must consider before deciding the best approach. Lastly, the practices of media are extremely important during these times. The question of "How much should be shared with the public in order to inform but not create panic in society?" All of these issues are very subjective and don't hold a single correct answer. That in itself is one of the greatest issues from this pandemic. Everybody has different opinions on what should be done to balance the advancement of humanity and health of humanity. 

**4. Engineering Ethics**

4.2.1) After reading the ACM's Code of Ethics I better understand the scale at which ethics is practiced in computer engineering. I always understood that it is a big part of CPE, but never realized how important and specific it is. As well as how seriously it is treated. One part of the Code of Ethics I found interesting was Section 2.6 - Perform work only in areas of competence. I think it is a crucial addition to make sure engineers are only working in areas that they accel in. This section forces efficiency in the advancement of computer engineering and technology. 

4.2.2) The Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct addresses the "rules" of participating in their open source community. It is targeted to any and all members of this community, in order to create a civil and efficient platform. The most important ethical behavior of this code is to provide an inspiring and safe platform for the entire community. The OSS from Microsoft we have been using for this course is Github.

4.2.3) The article hints that data ethics needs to be developed at the start of all other computer ethics categories and take into account all other computer macroethics. This is because data ethics is a small part of all other computer ethics subdomains.

4.2.4) The conference needs its own Code of Conduct to ensure that the interactions of everybody attending are safe and productive. Similar to why Microsoft needs a specific Code of Conduct for their open source platform.

4.2.5) Google is concerned that AI will arrise issues such as unfair bias, breach of individuals' privacy, and technology creation that is likely to cause harm. Google is referring to their responsibility to develop these technologies in ways that don't create, or create these issues as little as possible. 

4.2.6) The term "ethical hacking" seems strange because people normally associate ethics with doing the good or right thing. People also normally associate the word hacking with causing harm, or doing the wrong thing. "Ethical" and "hacking" can be strung together because hacking is often used to improve computer security. By using ethical hacking, we can decrease the use of unethical hacking by making it more complicated and difficult. 

**5. Codes of Conduct**

5.2.1) Defection in prisons arrises from individuals acting in what they think is their best interest, when actually their best interest is completely different. To counteract this defection, the punishments for rogue behavior needs to be greater. But also the corruption of authorities needs to be reduced. For example, a lot of murder in prison is only possible because an authoritative figure in the prison allows it to happen, from being bribed in some way. Defection in prison could never be completely stopped because people in prison - especially ones with long sentences - simply have nothing to lose. But I believe by increasing punishments and decreasing corruption, rogue behavior could be greatly reduced, not only in prisons but also society in general. 

5.2.2) The innovation that I would create at my startup would be the technology to allow mentally and physically disabled people to better interact with computers, specifically to play video games. I believe many people don't realize how beneficial video games can be to certain individuals, and my technology would allow more people to experience these benefits. Some of these benefits include, but are not limited to - reducing stress and trauma, educating in unorthodox manners, and generally entertaining. The technology would connect to the brain and any other limb or organ that the user is still capable or controlling. This would allow the user to interact with a computer or game just as any other healthy human would.

A)

1. One adverse effect of this technology would be the concern that the connection to the brain - or other body parts - could could be breached by an outside party. Data such as memories, or private thoughts could be collected from the user without them knowing, which is a complete breach of privacy and an ethical concern. I would use ethical hacking to ensure the data that this technology uses is unbreachable (even though I think that is technically impossible).

2. Another adverse effect would be peoples' belief that it's unethical to incorporate technology into our mind, whether it be religious beliefs or just the fact that connecting tech and our mind is somewhat frightening. I would counteract this by only offering my technology to the disabled if their primary care-takers agree that it is okay. I would also explain the technology to each user (or their care-taker) in the simplest way possible to ensure they understand how it works, and what it does. After that, it's up to them to decide if they would still like to participate.

3. Lastly, an adverse effect would be that the technology could cause harm to the user. Whether that be physical or mental harm. I would counteract this with thousands of hours of testing and research, and I would only pursue this technology if I was certain that it was safe. If at any point I saw my technology could be unsafe, I would no longer pursue it, because the potential harm would be far greater than the benefits it could bring. 

B) This technology would be benefical upon launch by helping many disabled individuals experience computing and or computer gaming. But a detriment of my technology would be after it has been absorbed by many, there would still be individuals unable to use it, whether that be because their care-takers won't allow them. Or they simply lack the brain capacity - even with my technology - to operate a computer. 

5.2.3) I would ensure that my technology "stays the course" by only hiring employees that truly see the benefits and want to help the disabled, not just make money.

5.2.4) My code of ethics would be:
1. Respect the privacy of all users
2. Ensure that the technology is 100% safe before testing and spreading to consumers.
3. Ensure that the user (or care-taker) understands all aspects of the technology and agrees to usage.
4. Ensure that the technology is not only used for entertainment, but also educational purposes.
